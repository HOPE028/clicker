# Clicker    -    [Live App](https://clicktheclicker.netlify.app/)

## About

App I thought of and developed in less then 15 minutes. Incredibly simple (on purpose) single counter item on a blank background. Everytime you click the screen, the counter increases.

## Why

Sometimes I have an odd urge to just go through my phone when I have a lot of anxiety or stress. Hence I started to think, maybe instead of just going on some social media platform and wondering endlessly, I should make an app designed to solve my problem. 

Thus I made this. It is very simple to make sure I am not distracted but still have something to click on and put my anxiety on. Once I have gotten to a point where I have regained control over my stress, I can easily leave without having to think twice.
